Assorted code projects from 2021 by Jason Raiti

## PCA_Faces_Github
Use Principal Component Analysis to conduct facial recognition. 
Manually compute PCA, then use the Mahalanobis distance to match images.

Use the archive folder as a data set of images: 40 faces , 10 images per face.

Download and Run the jupyter notebook (and dataset) but replace the directory value with the path of the directory you are working in locally.

Requires: 
matplotlib
PIL
numpy

## Pytorch_NN
Use Pytorch to set up a template for a single hidden layer NN.

Train the NN on an arbitrary function

Estimate the predictive precision of the resulting model
